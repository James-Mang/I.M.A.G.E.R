# I.M.A.G.E.R.
A Gravitational Microlensing Visualization Tool

This project is an interactive tool that allows the user to change the parameters of a gravitational lensing event and visualize its effects to build an intuition of the mathematical relationships present. More scientific background and information is provided in the PDF while the jupyter notebook provides more detailed instructions on how to use the interactive plots.
